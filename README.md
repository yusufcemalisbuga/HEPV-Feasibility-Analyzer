# HEPV-Feasibility-Analyzer
Feasibility study of Hybrid Electric-Pneumatic Vehicles (HEPV) for urban micro-mobility shows, via validated thermodynamic models, that compressed-air hybrids remain commercially unviable despite promising theory. Findings were presented at the 4th International Electronic Conference on Processes (ECP) 2025.
